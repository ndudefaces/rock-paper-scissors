This is my rock, paper, scissors game. This was pretty difficult for me, and I found myself having to look up what I felt were the most basic things (randomization, for loops, etc.). I think I have a decent understanding as to how it all comes together, and planning out/pseudocoding the functions really helped. The functions and if/else if portions were fairly simple, but I think understanding function scope and formatting was what really tripped me up. 

Honestly the game itself wasn't the difficult part, it was the game function and scorekeeping with the for loop that got to me. I had to look up a lot to see what exactly was going wrong, and I felt like I was sometimes overthinking what or what not to include in the loop. 

Actually, now that I look at all the small parts I put together, it makes sense to me looking back at it with a macro lens. Neat!
